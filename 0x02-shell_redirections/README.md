# Shell, I/O Redirections and filters

In this project, I learned about using the `head`, `tail`, `find`, `wc`, `sort`,
`uniq`, `grep`, and `tr` commands to redirect standard input and output and
combine commands in the Shell. Further, I learned about how special characters
work and how to filter text from files.
